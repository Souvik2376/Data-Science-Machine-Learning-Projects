# Breast Cancer Detection - Classification - Pycaret


## Dataset Information

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

## Attribute Information:

- 1) ID number

- 2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

- a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
- b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
- c) perimeter
- d) area
- e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
- f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
- g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
- h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
- i) symmetry
- j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

The mean, standard error and "worst" or largest (mean of the three largest values) of these features were computed for each image,
resulting in 30 features. For instance, field 3 is Mean Radius, field 13 is Radius SE, field 23 is Worst Radius.

All feature values are recoded with four significant digits.

Missing attribute values: none

Class distribution: 357 benign, 212 malignant
